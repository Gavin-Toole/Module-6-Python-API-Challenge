Weatherpy - Part 1 Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude

You should create the following plots:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

These 5 plots were saved to the output folder.

Weatherpy Part 1b Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

You should create the following plots:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modeling. Describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may uncover.

Part 2 - Vacationpy

1. Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

2. Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 18, Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s, zero cloudiness

3. For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

4. Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map as in the following image:
